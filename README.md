# course-schedule

This was a project for my artificial intelligence class. I had to create a program that automatically   
generates a course schedule for a computer science student. I used a library provided by my professor to implement
the hill climbing method of finding the best schedule created under certain constraints. I created the objective function
and all the other methods in CSCourses.py.

###Constraints
* The total number of credits taken per semester are between 12 and 18 credits
* All prequisites must be taken to take a course
* Certain courses must be taken in a particular semester
